       "   'value': 'Boolean operators are logical operators used in programming to manipulate boolean values. They operate on one or more boolean operands and return a boolean result. The three main boolean operators are \"AND\" (&&), \"OR\" (||), and \"NOT\" (!).\\n\\nThe \"AND\" operator returns true if both of its operands are true, and false otherwise. For example:\\n\\n```python\\nx = 5\\ny = 10\\nresult = (x > 0) and (y < 20)  # This expression evaluates to True\\n```\\n\\nThe \"OR\" operator returns true if at least one of its operands is true, and false otherwise. For example:\\n\\n```python\\nx = 5\\ny = 10\\nresult = (x > 0) or (y < 20)  # This expression evaluates to True\\n```\\n\\nThe \"NOT\" operator negates the boolean value of its operand. It returns true if the operand is false, and false if the operand is true. For example:\\n\\n```python\\nx = 5\\nresult = not (x > 10)  # This expression evaluates to True\\n```\\n\\nOperator precedence refers to the order in which operators are evaluated in an expression. It ensures that expressions are evaluated correctly. In most programming languages, logical AND has higher precedence than logical OR. For example:\\n\\n```python\\nresult = True or False and False  # This expression is evaluated as (True or (False and False)), which is True\\n```\\n\\nShort-circuit evaluation is a behavior where the second operand of a logical operator is not evaluated if the result can be determined based on the value of the first operand. In short-circuit evaluation, if the first operand of an \"AND\" operator is false, the second operand is not evaluated because the result will always be false. Similarly, if the first operand of an \"OR\" operator is true, the second operand is not evaluated because the result will always be true.\\n\\nIn programming languages that support short-circuit evaluation natively, you can use it to improve performance or avoid errors. For example:\\n\\n```python\\nif x != 0 and (y / x) > 10:\\n    # Perform some operation\\n```\\n\\nIn languages without native short-circuit evaluation, you can implement your own logic to achieve the same behavior. Here\\'s an example in pseudocode:\\n\\n```\\nif x != 0 {\\n    if (y / x) > 10 {\\n        // Perform some operation\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nTruthiness and falsiness refer to how non-boolean values are evaluated in boolean contexts. In many programming languages, non-zero numbers and non-empty strings are considered truthy, while zero, empty strings, and null/None values are considered falsy.\\n\\nWhen evaluating boolean expressions, truthiness and falsiness come into play. For example:\\n\\n```python\\nx = 5\\nresult = x  # The value of x is truthy, so result is also truthy\\n```\\n\\nTo handle cases where truthiness and falsiness are implemented differently across programming languages, you can explicitly check the desired condition. For example:\\n\\n```python\\nx = 5\\nresult = bool(x)  # Explicitly converting x to a boolean value\\n```\\n\\nThis ensures that the result is always a boolean value, regardless of the language\\'s truthiness and falsiness rules.'}],\n",

      "The key principles of investment are as follows:\n",
      "1. **Risk and Return**: The principle states that there is a direct relationship between risk and return. The higher the risk, the higher the potential return and vice versa. This means that investors should be aware of the potential risks involved in an investment and consider them while making an investment decision.\n",
      "2. **Time Value of Money**: This principle suggests that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar in the future. This is because money received today can be invested to earn interest or used to generate returns, whereas money received in the future will have to be invested for a longer period to earn the same returns.\n",
      "3. **Diversification**: Diversification is the principle of spreading investments across different asset classes to reduce risk. This means that an investor should not put all their eggs in one basket, but instead, they should diversify their investments to minimize risk.\n",
      "4. **Dollar-Cost Averaging**: This principle involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the market conditions. This helps to reduce the impact of market volatility and timing risks.\n",
      "5. **Compound Interest**: Compound interest is the interest earned on both the principal amount and any accrued interest over time. This means that the interest earned in the future is based on the principal amount plus the interest earned in the past.\n",
      "6. **Liquidity**: Liquidity refers to the ease with which an investment can be converted into cash. Investors should consider the liquidity of their investments to ensure that they can easily access their money when needed.\n",
      "7. **Costs and Fees**: Investors should be aware of the costs and fees associated with an investment, such as brokerage commissions, management fees, and other expenses. These costs can eat into the returns on investment and reduce the overall returns.\n",
      "8. **Tax Efficiency**: Tax efficiency is the principle of minimizing taxes on investments to maximize returns. Investors should consider the tax implications of their investments and aim to minimize tax liabilities.\n",
      "9. **Active vs. Passive Investing**: Active investing involves actively managing investments to try to beat the market, while passive investing involves investing in a diversified portfolio that tracks a specific market index, such as the S&P 500. Both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages, and investors should choose the approach that best aligns with their investment goals and risk tolerance.\n",
      "10. **Long-Term Focus**: The long-term focus principle suggests that investors should focus on long-term returns rather than short-term gains. This means that investors should be\n"
